This was my attempt at fulfiling my desire of learning NSOperation and NSOperationQueus. 
I would like to thank Zalando because i read their whole Maple Beacon API and learnt a lot from it. Most of the code is same with some adjustments regarding creating operation queues and marking the NSOperation as finished.
